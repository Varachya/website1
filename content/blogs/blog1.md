Hi, my name is Varachya Teeraseranee but you can call me by my nickname, Mink.
I am from Bangkok Thailand but worked in Singapore for 6 years.
I studied accounting in my undergrad. At LBS, Im doing MBA with the concentration on tech and analytic.
Prior to MBA, I was working in different roles with Standard Chartered bank in Bangkok and Singapore. I started off in corporate finance where I originated debt capital market and leveraged finance transactions for companies in Southeast Asia.  After that I joined internal strategy team, formulating strategies for the bank with the focus on corporate and institutional business. 
I am a foodie. I like to cook and enjoy trying new dishes, especially spicy food. I also like to take photos.
