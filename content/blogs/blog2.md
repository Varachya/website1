description: From the outside world, young female Thai expats in the nightlife industry are often looked down upon, especially in a conservative and disciplined society like Singapore. Many of these women came to Singapore seeking better lives. As a female Thai expat who came for the same reason, I hoped to change this perception of Thai women.

When Covid hit, many aspects of the economy were hurt, but one never discussed was the nightlife industry. The women I used to see standing outside of clubs were now standing on the street cooking Thai food. 

Seeing them work, I realised they simply wanted to make a living on their own, and they ignored the stigma that society had attached to them. I admired them for this, and I soon began feeling much more camaraderie toward them. They were simply trying to survive in an economy not designed for them, but now, in the new Covid economy, they were valuable in a new way, and I knew I needed to help.

Therefore, I began buying my food exclusively from the women. The food was delicious and reminded me of my favorite restaurant in Bangkok. I learned that due to language barrier, most were only selling to other Thais in a Facebook group. Because Thai food is one of the most popular cuisines in the world, I knew they were limiting their potential.

I supported them by ordering not only for myself but also for my foreign friends and colleagues. The feedback was so favourable that I suggested that they expand to sell to non-Thais too. However, they were intimidated by this idea because they did not have the language skills or experience to do so.

Therefore, I helped them scale their business by encouraging them to expand to social media channels beyond Facebook. We also worked together to make small but inviting changes to their online presence, such as translating their Thai menu and Facebook page into English and taking photos of their special dishes that they could use to promote across their social media profiles.  

Soon, they were taking orders directly from non-Thai customers, increasing their income. One of the women was so successful that I advised her to set up a stall in my neighborhood, which has a high demand for street food. 

As a result of the pandemic, the female Thai community has become much closer. Covid was an equaliser in this way. I was also able to expand their target customers from the less than 100 Thais in Singapore to the entire 5.7 million residents, allowing these women to flourish during the darkest times.
