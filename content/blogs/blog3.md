I want to share my journey of culinary exploration. I am always a food lover and I enjoy cooking Asian dishes.
Moving to London for an MBA, I stepped out of my comfort zone and delve into the world of Western cuisine.
I enrolled in a one-day Beef Wellington course at the Gordon Ramsay Academy. Learning from an instructor trained by the legendary Gordon Ramsay himself was a great opportunity.
I was joined by other food lovers who shared the same passion. Together, we started an exciting journey filled with new flavors and techniques. 
During the course, I tried out different cooking methods and experimented with ingredients I wasn't familiar with such as puff pastry, duxelles, and parma ham.
London is my culinary playground, where I as an amateur, continue to learn and grow. I will try more dishes and keep practicing
