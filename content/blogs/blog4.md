description: The Corporate and Institutional Banking space is extremely competitive in Southeast Asia, with numerous local and international firms able to offer full product suites such as IPOs, bond offerings, and lending. Moreover, most large corporates in Southeast Asia are already well banked, especially in Singapore and Thailand.

Therefore, my goal is to return to the Global Business Development Team of Standard Chartered Singapore and further expand our Corporate and Institutional Banking presence in Africa, a severely underbanked and underserved region, but with a PPP GDP of $6.7 trillion.

My first focus will be Nigeria, the continentâ€™s largest nominal economy. I will build on our cash services engagement to expand our service offerings to more portions of the government, increasing their access to international banking, whilst also growing our knowledge of their economy. By essentially developing a customised internal credit rating of these historically opaque economies, we can then provide wider range of lending and bond offerings to corporates in Africa with a level of accuracy not previously possible.

Speaking to investors in Asia, there is a strong appetite for investment in Africa due to high return, but there are few international banks with a significant presence, and even fewer investment vehicles to allow global access. I therefore plan to use our full banking capability and better understanding of countries in Africa, such as Nigeria, Angola, and Tanzania, to create financial products to be sold to our strong investor base in Asia out of Singapore, helping both investors in Asia and corporates in Africa grow their businesses simultaneously.

With these combined operational expansions and improvements, my executives and I are confident that I can gain technical knowledge and a global network from LBS MBA to expand our services, creating additional revenue by $100 million within 3 years after my return. Moreover, building on the transparency we will build during my MBA, I can also create our new financial product offerings, which would generate incremental revenue of $300 million by 2027.
